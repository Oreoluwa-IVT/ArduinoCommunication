# Arduino Communication Examples

This repository contains code examples for different communication protocols between two Arduinos.

## SPI Communication

The SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) protocol is commonly used for communication between microcontrollers and peripherals. The SPI folder contains the following examples:

- [SPI_Master.c](./SPI/SPI_Master.c): Arduino code for the master Arduino that sends data via SPI.
- [SPI_Slave.c](./SPI/SPI_Slave.c): Arduino code for the slave Arduino that receives data via SPI.

## I2C Communication

The I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol is widely used for communication between integrated circuits. The I2C folder contains the following examples:

- [I2C_Master.c](./I2C/I2C_Master.c): Arduino code for the master Arduino that sends data via I2C.
- [I2C_Slave.c](./I2C/I2C_Slave.c): Arduino code for the slave Arduino that receives data via I2C.

## UART Communication

UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) is a serial communication protocol commonly used for point-to-point communication. The UART folder contains the following examples:

- [UART_Transmitter.c](./UART/UART_Transmitter.c): Arduino code for the transmitter Arduino that sends data via UART.
- [UART_Receiver.c](./UART/UART_Receiver.c): Arduino code for the receiver Arduino that receives data via UART.
